Hunters start with a score of 366

When Hunters and Dracula are in the same city, they have an Encounter,and Dracula loses health.

Dracula knows where the hunters are but the Hunters do not know where Dracula is

If a Hunter enters a city where Dracula has been in any of his last 6 turns then the Hunter deduce precisely when he was there.

Dracula's last 6 turns is called his Trail...

Dracula also leaves traps (sometimes called minions) and immature Vampires behind him in every city he visits.

Every 13 rounds Dracula leaves behind a new immature Vampire, After 6 rounds the Vampire matures, and the score decreases by 13. Although, if a hunter comes to the same city as the immature vampire, he kills it and prevents the score loss.

Note that Dracula places a Trap/Vampire as soon as he enters a city (i.e Automatically every time he enters a city).
 
Hunters start with 9 life points (which can't be exceeded). When a hunter loses his all life points, he is magically transported to the Hospital St Joseph and St Mary (this ends their turn) and the score decreases by 6 points. On the hunter's next turn he regains full health (9 points)
 
 On the other hand if Dracula loses all his blood then he is vanquished. i.e(GG)

Hunters can move by road, rail, or sea. 

Dracula can only move by road or sea and every turn he spends at sea loses him 2 blood points.
 
Moving by road means moving from one city to another city that is directly connected to by a single road segment.
 
Moving by rail is less reliable, sometimes Hunters can move up to 3, 2, 1, or 0 (Random). Need to divide a randod seed by 4 and get it's remainder.
 
Moving by sea is neat... you can rapidly travel a long way. Unfortunately Hunters can never encounter Dracula while they are at sea, even if the hunter and dracula are at the same sea.
